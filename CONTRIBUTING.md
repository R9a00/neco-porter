### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:

- Issues labeled `good first issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- Issues labeled `help wanted` - issues which need extra attention

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain neco-porter's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible neco-porter
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, commented code
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests if applicable

3. **Ensure the test suite passes**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Run the linter**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add some feature"
   ```
   
   Follow our commit message conventions:
   - Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
   - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
   - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

6. **Push to your fork**

## v2 Development Guidelines

### Working with Multi-Port Features

When contributing to v2 features:
1. Maintain backward compatibility
2. Test with both v1 and v2 clients
3. Update TypeScript definitions
4. Add tests for multi-port scenarios

### Code Organization

- `src/necoportd.js` - v1 daemon (keep unchanged)
- `src/necoportd-v2.js` - v2 daemon with multi-port support
- `src/db-utils.js` - Database utilities and migration
- `lib/necoport.js` - v1 client library
- `lib/necoport-v2.js` - v2 client library
- `bin/necoport-client` - v1 CLI (keep unchanged)
- `bin/necoport-client-v2` - v2 CLI with new features

### Testing v2 Features

```bash
# Run v2 daemon
./src/necoportd-v2.js &

# Test multi-port allocation
./bin/necoport-client-v2 exec test --ports a,b,c bash -c 'env | grep PORT'

# Test backward compatibility
./bin/necoport-client exec test npm run dev
```

## Cat ASCII Art Guidelines

When adding new cat ASCII art:
- Keep them under 20 characters wide
- Use standard ASCII/Unicode characters
- Test in various terminals
- Ensure they bring joy!
- Add them to the `getCatForPort` function in `src/necoportd.js` and `src/necoportd-v2.js`

Example:
```
(=^ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•^=)  # Classic cat
(=^‚Ä•^=)    # Content cat
(=ÔΩÄœâ¬¥=)   # Determined cat
```
